# My First Eldritch Evil
My First Eldritch Evil (may also be referred to as MFEE in the following document) is designed to be the worst possible Tamagatchi-style game â€” in the best possible way. MFEE takes all of the joy out of pet care and puts in all of the frustration of doing your taxes. 

## Description
MFEE is a text-based program where you raise the worst pet ever imaginable.

## Storyline
You have been forcefully tasked with taking care of your aunt's horrible pet of unknown origin. 

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
Powershell

### Installing
Download [this file](<!-- Link -->).
\nExtract the ["program with PowerShell script to run.7z"](https://github.com/skidoodl/My-First-Eldritch-Evil/releases/download/java/program.with.powershell.script.to.run.7z) zip folder.

### Executing Program
Right-click the ".RUN THIS IN POWERSHELL TO PLAY.ps1" file and press "Run with Powershell"
If you know what you are doing I have also included the [.jar file](https://github.com/skidoodl/My-First-Eldritch-Evil/releases/download/java/program.jar).

## Help
If you are having trouble getting this to work, make sure [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is installed. \nThis is a somewhat buggy mess and may crash. Also, the only way to end the game is to die or press ctrl+c in the command prompt line.
