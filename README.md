# My First Eldritch Evil
My First Eldritch Evil (may be referred to as MFEE in the following document) is designed to be the worst possible Tamagatchi-style game â€” in the best possible way. MFEE takes all of the joy out of pet care and puts in all of the frustration of doing your taxes. 

## Description
MFEE is a text-based program where you raise the worst pet ever imaginable. It was created as a submission for the Congressional App Challenge by two idiots in about a month. Players embark on a console-based... experience where they can raise their very own Lovecraftian creature! Some of the things the player can do include:
* Naming their pet
* Feeding their pet
* Exercising their pet
* Cuddling their pet (Note: This option is highly discouraged).
* Healing their pet if it gets sick

## Storyline
You have been forcefully tasked with taking care of your aunt's horrible pet of unknown origin. 

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
Powershell

### Installing
* Windows: Download [this file](https://github.com/skidoodl/My-First-Eldritch-Evil/releases/download/v1.1/eldritch.with.ps.script.7z), then extract its contents.
* Mac: Mac release (maybe) coming soon.

### Executing Program
* Windows: Run the file ps1 file named ".RUN THIS IN POWERSHELL TO PLAY.ps1" with Powershell to play.

</p>If you know what you are doing, we have also included the [.jar file](https://github.com/skidoodl/My-First-Eldritch-Evil/releases/download/v1.1/eldritch.jar).

## Help
If you are having trouble getting this to work, make sure [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is installed. This is a somewhat buggy mess and may crash. Also, the only way to end the game is to die or press ctrl+c in the command prompt line.
