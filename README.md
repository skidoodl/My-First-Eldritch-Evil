# My First Eldritch Evil
My First Eldritch Evil (may be referred to as MFEE in the following document) is designed to be the worst possible Tamagatchi-style game â€” in the best possible way. MFEE takes all of the joy out of pet care and puts in all of the frustration of doing your taxes. 

## Description
MFEE is a text-based program where you raise the worst pet ever imaginable. It was created as a submission for the Congressional App Challenge by two idiots in about a month. Embark on a console-based... "experience" where you can raise your very own Lovecraftian creature! Some of the things you can do include:
* Naming your pet
* Feeding your pet
* Exercising your pet
* Cuddling your pet (Note: This option is highly discouraged).
* Healing your pet if it gets sick

Due to your pet's... sinister nature, there is a possibility that it may turn evil. You must endeavor to calm down your pet before it destroys you (and the world). However, you must not kill it because killing animals is bad (even if your's definitely isn't innocent).

## Storyline
You have been forcefully tasked with taking care of your aunt's horrible pet of unknown origin. Apparently, she bought the egg from Facebook Marketplace?

* Bash
* JavaFX

### Installing

## Play Guide
### Items - Using the Inventory and Shop
Blabla

### Feeding Your Pet
Just as you need to eat food to stay alive, so too must your pet obtain nutrients by consuming its own... "food." As time goes on, your pet will become hungry. Your pet's hunger level is measured by "Satiation." Low satiation (<1.0) means your pet is hungry. Luckily for you, feeding it is not difficult. Once you purchase food from the shop, it will appear in your inventory. Then, there are two ways to feed it: Either select food from your inventory and then choose "Use" from the list of options it gives you, or select "Feed [Pet Name]" from the main menu. A pop-up will appear where you can then select the amount of food to feed your pet. You can give it as much or as little food as you want, but be careful: feed it too much food and your pet will become unhealthy, or worse, dead.

### Sleeping the Pet
Once you put the pet to sleep, you will see it begin to snooze in the pet display panel. The pet will continue to sleep until woken by the player (clicking on the pet).

## Help
If you are having trouble getting this to work, make sure [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is installed. This is a somewhat buggy mess and may crash. Also, the only way to end the game is to die or press ctrl+c in the command prompt line.
