# My First Eldritch Evil
My First Eldritch Evil (may be referred to as MFEE in the following document) is designed to be the worst possible Tamagatchi-style game â€” in the best possible way. MFEE takes all of the joy out of pet care and puts in all of the frustration of doing your taxes. 

## Description
MFEE is a text-based program where you raise the worst pet ever imaginable. It was created as a submission for the Congressional App Challenge by two idiots in about a month. Embark on a console-based... experience where you can raise your very own Lovecraftian creature! Some of the things you can do include:
* Naming your pet
* Feeding your pet
* Exercising your pet
* Cuddling your pet (Note: This option is highly discouraged).
* Healing your pet if it gets sick

Due to your pet's... sinister nature, there is a possibility that it may turn evil. You must endeavor to calm down your pet before it destroys you (and the world). However, you must not kill it because killing animals is bad (even if your's definitely isn't innocent).

## Storyline
You have been forcefully tasked with taking care of your aunt's horrible pet of unknown origin. Apparently, she bought the egg from Facebook Marketplace?

## Help
If you are having trouble getting this to work, make sure [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is installed. This is a somewhat buggy mess and may crash. Also, the only way to end the game is to die or press ctrl+c in the command prompt line.
